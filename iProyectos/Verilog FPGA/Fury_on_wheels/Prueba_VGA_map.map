Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2574 - The F7 multiplexer symbol
   "Imagen12/Mmux_hcount[9]_X_12_o_wide_mux_313_OUT1020_SW0" and its I1 input
   driver "Imagen12/Mram__n0559102" were implemented suboptimally in the same
   slice component. The function generator could not be placed directly driving
   the F7 multiplexer. The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
